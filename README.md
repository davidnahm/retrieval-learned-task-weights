# retrieval-learned-task-weights
This repo contains several notebooks that examine the robustness of uncertainty-based learned task weights in the presence of label noise. These notebooks contain the source code to run experiments on noisy polynomials, image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10), and cross-modal retrieval.
